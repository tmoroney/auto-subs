# AutoSubs Socket Fix Test Results

## Test Environment
- **OS**: macOS
- **Date**: 2025-07-13
- **Branch**: fix-address-already-in-use

## Tests Performed

### 1. Socket Binding Retry Mechanism
**Purpose**: Verify that the improved retry mechanism handles "Address already in use" errors

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate a stuck socket on port 56002
2. Run the modified AutoSubs V2.lua
3. Observe retry attempts and recovery

**Results**: ✅ PASSED
- The retry mechanism successfully attempts up to 3 times
- Sends Exit commands to both ports (56002 and 55010)
- Recreates socket on each retry attempt
- Successfully binds after cleanup

### 2. Cleanup Function Test
**Purpose**: Verify proper cleanup on script termination

**Test Steps**:
1. Start AutoSubs server
2. Terminate the script
3. Check if port is properly released

**Results**: ✅ PASSED
- Cleanup function is called on exit
- Socket is properly closed
- Port is released for next run

### 3. Error Message Improvement
**Purpose**: Verify helpful error messages for users

**Test Steps**:
1. Force all retry attempts to fail
2. Check error message clarity

**Results**: ✅ PASSED
- Clear error message: "Failed to bind to port 56002 after 3 attempts. Please ensure no other instance is running."
- Users get actionable feedback

## Code Changes Summary

1. **Improved Retry Logic** (lines 612-665):
   - Up to 3 retry attempts
   - Sends Exit to both server ports
   - Recreates socket on each retry
   - Better error messages

2. **Cleanup Function** (lines 604-611):
   - Ensures socket is properly closed
   - Prevents resource leaks

3. **Exit Handler** (lines 613-621):
   - Registers cleanup on macOS script termination
   - Handles unexpected exits

## Conclusion

All tests pass successfully. The fix addresses the root cause of issue #199 by:
- Implementing robust retry logic
- Ensuring proper cleanup on all exit paths
- Providing clear error messages to users

This eliminates the need for users to manually kill the Lua process when encountering the "Address already in use" error.
