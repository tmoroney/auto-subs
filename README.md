## Dev Setup (brief)
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install prerequisites for a Tauri app (Node.js + Rust toolchain). See: https://tauri.app
3. Run the UI:
   ```bash
   cd AutoSubs-App
   npm install
   npm run tauri dev
   ```
4. For Resolve integration during development, copy the Lua (AutoSubs.lua) script from `AutoSubs-App/src-tauri/resources/` into your Resolve scripts folder so Resolve can launch/connect to the dev app. Open the lua script and set it to dev mode via the variable at the top, then set the location where the git repo was cloned:
   - Windows: `%appdata%/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Support/Fusion/Scripts/Utility`
   - macOS: `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts/Utility`
   Then open it from Resolve via **Workspace → Scripts → AutoSubs**.

If you’re contributing to the backend, the Rust code lives under `AutoSubs-App/src-tauri/`.
