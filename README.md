# AutoSubs V1 (Legacy Version)
If your OS isn‚Äôt supported by **AutoSubs V2**, you can try **AutoSubs V1** using manual installation. However, this requires basic experience with Python and the terminal, and this version is no longer supported so any errors you will have to fix yourself.
>[!Warning]
If using the **free version**, you must be on **Resolve 19.0.3 or earlier**, as Blackmagic removed the built-in UI manager in v19.1.

### [AutoSubs V1 Install Guide](https://github.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/blob/a695224b66e46c62dc716f5336582795e7174f17/V1_README.md)

# Contribute to AutoSubs
If you would like to contribute to the development of AutoSubs, follow the steps below.
## Set Up for Development
1. Clone this repository to whatever directory you wish.
2. Copy the `AutoSubs V2.lua` file from the following directory within the repo: `auto-subs/AutoSubs-App/src-tauri/resources`
4. Paste the `AutoSubs V2.lua` file inside one of the directories below so that Resolve can see it:
  - Windows: `%appdata%\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Fusion\Scripts\Utility`
  - Mac: `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts/Utility`
3. Open `AutoSubs V2.lua` and set the variable `DEV_MODE` to true at the top of the file. Since we will be running the Tauri app in dev mode, we must turn on dev mode which will prevent the Lua server from opening the main Tauri application when the script it is started.

## Start Python Transcription Server
Open a new terminal in the repository and run the following commands to start the python transcription server. This python server is responsible for anything machine learning related such as Transcribing audio and Speaker Diarization.

### Mac (ARM)
```bash
cd Transcription-Server
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-mac.txt
```
### Windows
```bash
cd Transcription-Server
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements-win.txt
```
## Start LUA server
This LUA script is a server that runs in the background and waits to recieve a request from the frontend Tauri app. This script is responsable for any interaction with Resolve, such as adding Text+ subtitles to the timeline and exporting the timeline audio.
1. Open Resolve
2. Navigate to Scripts and open AutoSubs V2

## Start Tauri App (Frontend UI)
```bash
cd AutoSubs-App
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```
