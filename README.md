    scoop install ffmpeg

## Light Version
> [!NOTE]
> **Audio transcription has been removed on this version**. This means less setup, but a subtitles (SRT) file is required as input. Use this if you already have a way of transcribing video (such as Davinci Resolve Studio's built-in subtitles feature, or CapCut subtitles) and you just want subtitles with a custom theme.

#### Creates themed subtitles from an SRT file.
### Step 1
Install any version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (tick `"Add python.exe to PATH"` during installation)
### Step 2
Download **[`auto-subs-light.py`](https://github.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/blob/main/auto-subs-light.py)** and place it in the `Utility` folder of the Fusion Scripts folder.

# FAQ
### 1. Auto-Subs not opening
Verify that Resolve detects your Python installation by opening the Console from the top menu/toolbar in Resolve and clicking `py3` at the top of the console.
Ensure that `Path` in your system environment variables contains the following:
- `C:\Users\<your-user-name>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312`
- `C:\Users\<your-user-name>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts\`
### 2. Can't find Fusion folder
Use [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) to quickly search your computer for it (Windows only).
### 3. MacOS Error
    <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self-signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1006)>
**Solution:** Run this command in the terminal (replace the Python directory with wherever Python is installed on your computer).

    /Applications/Python\ 3.11/Install\ Certificates.command
### 4. Check Python version being used by Resolve
`import sys` + `print (sys.version)` in the Resolve console.
### 5. Issues during Whisper setup
