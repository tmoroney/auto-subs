----------------------------
In this package, you will find a brief introduction to the Scripting API for DaVinci Resolve Studio. Apart from this README.txt file, this package contains folders containing the basic import
modules for scripting access (DaVinciResolve.py) and some representative examples.

From v16.2.0 onwards, the nodeIndex parameters accepted by SetLUT() and SetCDL() are 1-based instead of 0-based, i.e. 1 <= nodeIndex <= total number of nodes.

Overview
--------
As with Blackmagic Fusion scripts, user scripts written in Lua and Python programming languages are supported. By default, scripts can be invoked from the Console window in the Fusion page,
or via command line. This permission can be changed in Resolve Preferences, to be only from Console, or to be invoked from the local network. Please be aware of the security implications when
allowing scripting access from outside of the Resolve application.

Prerequisites
-------------
DaVinci Resolve scripting requires one of the following to be installed (for all users):

    Lua 5.1
    Python >= 3.6 64-bit
    Python 2.7 64-bit

Using a script
--------------
DaVinci Resolve needs to be running for a script to be invoked.

For a Resolve script to be executed from an external folder, the script needs to know of the API location.
You may need to set the these environment variables to allow for your Python installation to pick up the appropriate dependencies as shown below:

    Mac OS X:
    RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API="/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Developer/Scripting"
    RESOLVE_SCRIPT_LIB="/Applications/DaVinci Resolve/DaVinci Resolve.app/Contents/Libraries/Fusion/fusionscript.so"
    PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API/Modules/"

    Windows:
    RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API="%PROGRAMDATA%\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Developer\Scripting"
    RESOLVE_SCRIPT_LIB="C:\Program Files\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\fusionscript.dll"
    PYTHONPATH="%PYTHONPATH%;%RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API%\Modules\"

    Linux:
    RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API="/opt/resolve/Developer/Scripting"
    RESOLVE_SCRIPT_LIB="/opt/resolve/libs/Fusion/fusionscript.so"
    PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API/Modules/"
    (Note: For standard ISO Linux installations, the path above may need to be modified to refer to /home/resolve instead of /opt/resolve)

As with Fusion scripts, Resolve scripts can also be invoked via the menu and the Console.

On startup, DaVinci Resolve scans the subfolders in the directories shown below and enumerates the scripts found in the Workspace application menu under Scripts.
Place your script under Utility to be listed in all pages, under Comp or Tool to be available in the Fusion page or under folders for individual pages (Edit, Color or Deliver). Scripts under Deliver are additionally listed under render jobs.
Placing your script here and invoking it from the menu is the easiest way to use scripts.
    Mac OS X:
      - All users: /Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts
      - Specific user:  /Users/<UserName>/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts
    Windows:
      - All users: %PROGRAMDATA%\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts
      - Specific user: %APPDATA%\Roaming\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Fusion\Scripts
    Linux:
      - All users: /opt/resolve/Fusion/Scripts  (or /home/resolve/Fusion/Scripts/ depending on installation)
      - Specific user: $HOME/.local/share/DaVinciResolve/Fusion/Scripts

The interactive Console window allows for an easy way to execute simple scripting commands, to query or modify properties, and to test scripts. The console accepts commands in Python 2.7, Python 3.6
and Lua and evaluates and executes them immediately. For more information on how to use the Console, please refer to the DaVinci Resolve User Manual.

This example Python script creates a simple project:

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import DaVinciResolveScript as dvr_script
    resolve = dvr_script.scriptapp("Resolve")
    fusion = resolve.Fusion()
    projectManager = resolve.GetProjectManager()
    projectManager.CreateProject("Hello World")

The resolve object is the fundamental starting point for scripting via Resolve. As a native object, it can be inspected for further scriptable properties - using table iteration and "getmetatable"
in Lua and dir, help etc in Python (among other methods). A notable scriptable object above is fusion - it allows access to all existing Fusion scripting functionality.


Running DaVinci Resolve in headless mode
----------------------------------------
DaVinci Resolve can be launched in a headless mode without the user interface using the -nogui command line option. When DaVinci Resolve is launched using this option, the user interface is disabled.
However, the various scripting APIs will continue to work as expected.

DaVinci Resolve API
-------------------
Some commonly used API functions are described below (*). As with the resolve object, each object is inspectable for properties and functions.

List and Dict Data Structures
-----------------------------
Beside primitive data types, Resolve's Python API mainly uses list and dict data structures. Lists are denoted by [ ... ] and dicts are denoted by { ... } above.
As Lua does not support list and dict data structures, the Lua API implements "list" as a table with indices, e.g. { [1] = listValue1, [2] = listValue2, ... }.
Similarly the Lua API implements "dict" as a table with the dictionary key as first element, e.g. { [dictKey1] = dictValue1, [dictKey2] = dictValue2, ... }.

Keyframe Mode information
-------------------------
This section covers additional notes for the functions Resolve.GetKeyframeMode() and Resolve.SetKeyframeMode(keyframeMode).

'keyframeMode' can be one of the following enums:
    - resolve.KEYFRAME_MODE_ALL     == 0
    - resolve.KEYFRAME_MODE_COLOR   == 1
    - resolve.KEYFRAME_MODE_SIZING  == 2

Integer values returned by Resolve.GetKeyframeMode() will correspond to the enums above.

Cloud Projects Settings
--------------------------------------
This section covers additional notes for the functions "ProjectManager:CreateCloudProject," "ProjectManager:ImportCloudProject," and "ProjectManager:RestoreCloudProject"

All three functions take in a {cloudSettings} dict, that have the following keys:
* resolve.CLOUD_SETTING_PROJECT_NAME: String, ["" by default]
* resolve.CLOUD_SETTING_PROJECT_MEDIA_PATH: String, ["" by default]
* resolve.CLOUD_SETTING_IS_COLLAB: Bool, [False by default]
* resolve.CLOUD_SETTING_SYNC_MODE: syncMode (see below), [resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_PROXY_ONLY by default]
* resolve.CLOUD_SETTING_IS_CAMERA_ACCESS: Bool [False by default]

Where syncMode is one of the following values:
* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_NONE,
* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_PROXY_ONLY,
* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_PROXY_AND_ORIG

All three "ProjectManager:CreateCloudProject," "ProjectManager:ImportCloudProject," and "ProjectManager:RestoreCloudProject" require resolve.PROJECT_MEDIA_PATH to be defined. "ProjectManager:CreateCloudProject" also requires resolve.PROJECT_NAME to be defined.

Looking up Project and Clip properties
--------------------------------------
This section covers additional notes for the functions "Project:GetSetting", "Project:SetSetting", "Timeline:GetSetting", "Timeline:SetSetting", "MediaPoolItem:GetClipProperty" and
"MediaPoolItem:SetClipProperty". These functions are used to get and set properties otherwise available to the user through the Project Settings and the Clip Attributes dialogs.

The functions follow a key-value pair format, where each property is identified by a key (the settingName or propertyName parameter) and possesses a value (typically a text value). Keys and values are
designed to be easily correlated with parameter names and values in the Resolve UI. Explicitly enumerated values for some parameters are listed below.

Some properties may be read only - these include intrinsic clip properties like date created or sample rate, and properties that can be disabled in specific application contexts (e.g. custom colorspaces
in an ACES workflow, or output sizing parameters when behavior is set to match timeline)

Getting values:
Invoke "Project:GetSetting", "Timeline:GetSetting" or "MediaPoolItem:GetClipProperty" with the appropriate property key. To get a snapshot of all queryable properties (keys and values), you can call
"Project:GetSetting", "Timeline:GetSetting" or "MediaPoolItem:GetClipProperty" without parameters (or with a NoneType or a blank property key). Using specific keys to query individual properties will
be faster. Note that getting a property using an invalid key will return a trivial result.

Setting values:
Invoke "Project:SetSetting", "Timeline:SetSetting" or "MediaPoolItem:SetClipProperty" with the appropriate property key and a valid value. When setting a parameter, please check the return value to
ensure the success of the operation. You can troubleshoot the validity of keys and values by setting the desired result from the UI and checking property snapshots before and after the change.

The following Project properties have specifically enumerated values:
"superScale" - the property value is an enumerated integer between 0 and 4 with these meanings: 0=Auto, 1=no scaling, and 2, 3 and 4 represent the Super Scale multipliers 2x, 3x and 4x.
               for super scale multiplier '2x Enhanced', exactly 4 arguments must be passed as outlined below. If less than 4 arguments are passed, it will default to 2x.
Affects:
• x = Project:GetSetting('superScale') and Project:SetSetting('superScale', x)
• for '2x Enhanced' --> Project:SetSetting('superScale', 2, sharpnessValue, noiseReductionValue), where sharpnessValue is a float in the range [0.0, 1.0] and noiseReductionValue is a float in the range [0.0, 1.0]

"timelineFrameRate" - the property value is one of the frame rates available to the user in project settings under "Timeline frame rate" option. Drop Frame can be configured for supported frame rates
                      by appending the frame rate with "DF", e.g. "29.97 DF" will enable drop frame and "29.97" will disable drop frame
Affects:
• x = Project:GetSetting('timelineFrameRate') and Project:SetSetting('timelineFrameRate', x)

The following Clip properties have specifically enumerated values:
"Super Scale" - the property value is an enumerated integer between 1 and 4 with these meanings: 1=no scaling, and 2, 3 and 4 represent the Super Scale multipliers 2x, 3x and 4x.
                for super scale multiplier '2x Enhanced', exactly 4 arguments must be passed as outlined below. If less than 4 arguments are passed, it will default to 2x.
Affects:
• x = MediaPoolItem:GetClipProperty('Super Scale') and MediaPoolItem:SetClipProperty('Super Scale', x)
• for '2x Enhanced' --> MediaPoolItem:SetClipProperty('Super Scale', 2, sharpnessValue, noiseReductionValue), where sharpnessValue is a float in the range [0.0, 1.0] and noiseReductionValue is a float in the range [0.0, 1.0]

"Cloud Sync" = the property value is an enumerated integer that will correspond to one of the following enums:
* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_DEFAULT                == -1
* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_DOWNLOAD_IN_QUEUE      == 0
* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_DOWNLOAD_IN_PROGRESS   == 1
* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_DOWNLOAD_SUCCESS       == 2
* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_DOWNLOAD_FAIL          == 3
* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_DOWNLOAD_NOT_FOUND     == 4

* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_UPLOAD_IN_QUEUE        == 5
* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_UPLOAD_IN_PROGRESS     == 6
* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_UPLOAD_SUCCESS         == 7
* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_UPLOAD_FAIL            == 8
* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_UPLOAD_NOT_FOUND       == 9

* resolve.CLOUD_SYNC_SUCCESS                == 10

Audio Mapping
---------------
This section covers the output for mpItem.GetAudioMapping() and timelineItem.GetSourceAudioChannelMapping()
Mapping format (json result) is similar for mpItem and timelineItem.

This section will follow an example of an mpItem that has audio from its embedded source, and from two other clips that are linked to it.
The audio clip attributes of this mpItem will show 3 tracks.

Assume that (A) the embedded track is of format/type 'stereo' (2 channels),
            (B) linked clip 1 track is of format/type '7.1' (8 channels),
            (C) linked clip 2 track is '5.1' (6 channels)
and assume that the format/type was not changed further.

mpItem.GetAudioMapping() returns a string of the form:
    {
      "embedded_audio_channels": 2,                 # Total number of embedded channels across all tracks
      "linked_audio": {                             # A list of only linked audio information

          "channels": 6,
          "path": FILE_PATH
        }
      },
      "track_mapping": {                            # Listing of all the tracks. Output here will match what is seen in the audio clip attributes menu on the UI.
        "1": {
          "channel_idx": [1, 3],                    # In this case, channel index '1' corresponds to first channel of (A), channel index '3' will correspond to the first channel of (B)
          "mute": true,                             # Mute 'true' indicates track is muted. Valid value is true/false.
          "type": "Stereo"                          # The length of the 'channel_idx' list will always correspond to the number of channels the format specified in 'type' will allow.
                                                    # In this case, 'Stereo' allows 2 channels and so the length of the 'channel_idx' list is 2.
        },
        "2": {
          "channel_idx": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], # Channel indices here are following the default for (B)
          "mute": true,
          "type": "7.1"
        },
        "3": {
          "channel_idx": [1, 1, 1, 1, 15, 16],      # The first four channels for this track correspond to the first channel of (A), and the final 2 follow the default for (C)
          "mute": false,
          "type": "5.1"
        }
      }
    }

This section covers the parameters for the argument Export(fileName, exportType, exportSubtype).

exportType can be one of the following constants:
    - resolve.EXPORT_AAF
    - resolve.EXPORT_DRT
    - resolve.EXPORT_EDL
    - resolve.EXPORT_FCP_7_XML
    - resolve.EXPORT_FCPXML_1_8
    - resolve.EXPORT_FCPXML_1_9
    - resolve.EXPORT_FCPXML_1_10
    - resolve.EXPORT_HDR_10_PROFILE_A
    - resolve.EXPORT_HDR_10_PROFILE_B
    - resolve.EXPORT_TEXT_CSV
    - resolve.EXPORT_TEXT_TAB
    - resolve.EXPORT_DOLBY_VISION_VER_2_9
    - resolve.EXPORT_DOLBY_VISION_VER_4_0
    - resolve.EXPORT_DOLBY_VISION_VER_5_1
    - resolve.EXPORT_OTIO
    - resolve.EXPORT_ALE
    - resolve.EXPORT_ALE_CDL
exportSubtype can be one of the following enums:
    - resolve.EXPORT_NONE
    - resolve.EXPORT_AAF_NEW
    - resolve.EXPORT_AAF_EXISTING
    - resolve.EXPORT_CDL
    - resolve.EXPORT_SDL
    - resolve.EXPORT_MISSING_CLIPS
Please note that exportSubType is a required parameter for resolve.EXPORT_AAF and resolve.EXPORT_EDL. For rest of the exportType, exportSubtype is ignored.
When exportType is resolve.EXPORT_AAF, valid exportSubtype values are resolve.EXPORT_AAF_NEW and resolve.EXPORT_AAF_EXISTING.
When exportType is resolve.EXPORT_EDL, valid exportSubtype values are resolve.EXPORT_CDL, resolve.EXPORT_SDL, resolve.EXPORT_MISSING_CLIPS and resolve.EXPORT_NONE.
Note: Replace 'resolve.' when using the constants above, if a different Resolve class instance name is used.
